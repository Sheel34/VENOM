# VENOM
VENOM is a cutting-edge robotic system designed to redefine human-robot interaction, particularly in high-stakes applications like bomb disposal. Traditional robotic manipulators have long been hindered by non-intuitive joystick-based controls, demanding extensive training and introducing delays that can be catastrophic in time-sensitive scenarios.
